### Hi there, I'm Justin 👋

I'm a software engineer with a background in journalism, conflict analysis and open source intelligence. 

Some projects I'm proud of:
- 🔎 [Wayback Google Analytics](https://github.com/Bellingcat/wayback-google-analytics): An OSINT tool for uncovering connections between seemingly disparate websites using historic Google Analytics data. You can also read my article about using it to [uncover disinformation networks](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/01/09/using-the-wayback-machine-and-google-analytics-to-uncover-disinformation-networks/) for Bellingcat. 

I've also built some full stack web apps using React, Express, Flask and other technologies:
- 💻 [Syria Daily Brief](https://github.com/jclark1913/SyriaDailyBrief): An AI-powered full stack data collector and aggregator for Arabic-language media
- 🐦 [SillyBird](https://github.com/jclark1913/warbler): A social media app built in Flask and Postgres, but with less disinfo than the other bird website. [Live demo](https://sillybird.justinclark.bio) 
- 👔 [JobHunter](https://github.com/jclark1913/jobly-frontend): An Indeed-inspired job board built with Express, React & Postgres. [Live demo](https://jobhunter.justinclark.bio)
