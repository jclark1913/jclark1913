### Hi there, I'm Justin 👋

I'm a software engineer with a background in journalism, conflict analysis and open source intelligence. I'm passionate about leveraging tech for good and finding projects that trigger my inner obsessive researcher and push me down the rabbit hole. 

Some projects I'm proud of:
- 💻 [Syria Daily Brief](https://github.com/jclark1913/SyriaDailyBrief): An AI-powered full stack data collector and aggregator for Arabic-language media
- 🔎 [Wayback Google Analytics](https://github.com/Bellingcat/wayback-google-analytics): An OSINT tool for uncovering connections between seemingly disparate websites using historic Google Analytics data. You can also read my article about using it to [uncover disinformation networks](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/01/09/using-the-wayback-machine-and-google-analytics-to-uncover-disinformation-networks/) for Bellingcat. 

I've also built some full stack web apps using React, Express, Flask and other technologies:
- 🐦 [SillyBird](https://github.com/jclark1913/warbler): A social media app built in Flask and Postgres, but with less disinfo than the other bird website. [Live demo](https://sillybird.justinclark.bio) 
- 👔 [JobHunter](https://github.com/jclark1913/jobly-frontend): An Indeed-inspired job board built with Express, React & Postgres. [Live demo](https://jobhunter.justinclark.bio)
